<h3><b><ul>INTRODUCTION</ul></b></h3>
According to the father of Artificial Intelligence, John McCarthy, it is “The science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs”.
Artificial Intelligence is a way of making a computer, a computer-controlled robot, or a software think intelligently, in the similar manner the intelligent humans think.
AI is accomplished by studying how human brain thinks, and how humans learn, decide, and work while trying to solve a problem, and then using the outcomes of this study as a basis of developing intelligent software and systems.
Artificial Intelligence is the study of ideas that enable computers to be intelligent.
Artificial Intelligence is the part of computer science concerned with design of computer systems that exhibit human intelligence (From the Concise Oxford Dictionary).
Artificial Intelligence will define the next generation of software solutions. It can be used to build smart apps that help organizations be more efficient and enrich people’s lives.
